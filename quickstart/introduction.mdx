<Note>
  In this quickstart guide, you will learn how to set up your Unity project to
  work with Madder. We will be using a sample game manager, player, and player
  manager to demonstrate how to interact with Madder. This guide assumes you are
  following along using the assets provided in the Madder Starter Pack, but you
  can follow along using your own assets.
</Note>
## Prerequisites

- Unity Hub installed
- Unity 2019.4 LTS or newer
