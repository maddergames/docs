## Test your game in the Unity Editor

Press `Play` in the Unity Editor to test your game. Once the scene loads, press `J` to simulate a player joining
the game. The `MadderControllerTest` script will simulate the Madder Controller input. You should see a large stick
figure appear on the screen and move in a random direction. Press `J` again and you will see second stick figure appear
and move in another random direction.

<Info>
  In the `SamplePlayerInput` asset, we have also bound the player's movement to
  to the WASD keys. This binding only applies to the first player to join; the
  rest will be controlled solely by the Madder controller. We did this so it's
  easier to directly test input when needed in the Unity Editor.

### Manual Testing

If you would like to test other inputs from the Madder controller, you can follow the same pattern that is found in the
`MadderControllerTest` script. Simply create a JSON object with the input in the following format:

```jsonControllerState
        {
            "name":" "gamer1",
            "joystick":
            {
                "x": 0.1f,
                "y": 0.1f
            },
            "circle": true,
            "triangle": false,
            "plus": false
        }
```

<Note>
  Simply creating a `MadderControllerState` object, parsing it into a JSON
  string, and passing it to the `MadderManager` could work but is not
  recommended. The Madder server sends the controller state with slightly
  different formatting than the `MadderControllerState` object. The
  `MadderManager` will handle the conversion for you. See the
  [MadderManager](/madder-classes/madder-manager#updatemaddercontrollerstate)
  documentation for more information.
