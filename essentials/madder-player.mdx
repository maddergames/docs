## Madder Player

### Overview

The Madder Player class is sent to the Unity game from the Madder server to register a Madder controller with the game in the [Madder Manager's](madder-manager#registermaddercontroller) `RegisterMadderController` method.
The Madder Player class is also used to update the player's account with stats.
This class contains the player's gamername and a dictionary of [MadderStat](madder-stat) objects.

```csharp
[System.Serializable]
public class MadderPlayer
{
    public string name;

    public Dictionary<string, IMadderStat> stats;

}
```

### Usage

The Madder Manager does not keep a list of MadderPlayers that have joined the game.
To update a Madder Player's stats, you will need to call the [Madder Messager's](madder-messager#updatemadderplayerstats) `UpdateMadderPlayerStats` method.
