## Overview

The Madder Controller Manager is a Singleton class that manages the Madder Controllers in the Unity game. The Madder
Controller Manager is responsible for registering Madder Controllers with the Unity Input System and maintains a
dictionary of registered Madder Controllers.

This class should not be directly interacted with; all interactions with the Madder Controller Manager should be done
through the [Madder Manager](madder-manager).

## Usage

The Madder Starter Pack contains a prefab called `MadderControllerManager` that should be placed in the scene.

Because the Madder Controller Manager is a Singleton class, it will persist across scene loads.
